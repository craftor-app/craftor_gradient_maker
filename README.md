The Gradient Generator for Flutter is an open-source project that provides an easy-to-use interface for generating gradients in Flutter applications. With this tool, users can quickly create three types of gradients: radial, linear, and sweep, without the need for manual coding. Additionally, users can copy the generated gradient code with just a click of a button, saving development time and effort.
